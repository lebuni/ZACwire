Arduino Library to read the ZACwire protocol, wich is used by TSic temperature sensors 206, 306 and 506 on their signal pin.

`ZACwire<int pin> obj(int Sensor)` tells the library which input pin of the controller (eg. 2) and type of sensor (eg. 306) it should use

`.begin()` returns true if a signal is detected on the specific pin and starts the reading via ISRs. It should be started at least 120ms before the first .getTemp().

`.getTemp()` returns the temperature in °C and gets usually updated every 100ms. In case of a noisy signal, it returns 222


## Benefits compared to former TSic libraries
- saves a lot of controller time, because no delay() is used and calculations are done by bit manipulation
- low memory consumption
- misreading rate lower than 0.01%
- reading an unlimited number of TSic simultaneously
- higher accuracy (0.1°C offset corrected)
- simple use






## Example
```c++
#include <ZACwire.h>

ZACwire<2> Sensor(306);		// set pin "2" to receive signal from the TSic "306"

void setup() {
  Serial.begin(500000);
  
  if (Sensor.begin() == TRUE) {     //check if a sensor is connected to the pin
    Serial.println("Signal found on pin 2");
  }
  delay(120);
}

void loop() {
  float Input = Sensor.getTemp();     //get the Temperature in °C
  
  if (Input == 222) {
    Serial.println("Reading failed");
  }
  
  else {
    Serial.print("Temp: ");
    Serial.println(Input);
  }
  delay(100);
}
```
